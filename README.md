## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer is like a train track switch — many incoming tracks, but only one track leads to the destination. The control signal chooses which input gets through.
### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer is like a mail sorter — one stream of mail arrives, but the control system sends each piece to the correct mailbox/output.
### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannon’s)
